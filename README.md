# **Summary**

Archive is an e-commerce store selling **programming** books. 

This site has the aim to sell programming books to students and people interented in programming. I specifically choose more popular programming languages books to encourage interest and motivate to study the most popular programming languages out there, adn by that sell books. Another motivation from my side was to specifically fix the delivery cost, wherever customers live they always pay the same amout of delivery cost. Books can be searched, viewed either by being logged in or not, bags can be saved until users go back to online book store to later make a checkout. If logged in user make a purchase their order confirmation is sent by mail to their added E-mail address and will be saved to profile page. Customers that have not logged in can choose to create an account to proceed or make a secure checkout. If not logged in customer will recieve an order confirmation mail to added E-mail address.

Page owner/admin can arrange books by adding to store, edit or delete.
